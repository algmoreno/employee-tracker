of their employees.At the initializiation of the app, the user is given a list of options 
which include:

  - View all Departments
  - View all Roles
  - View all Employees
  - Add a Department
  - Add a Role
  - Add an Employee
  - Update an Employee Role

In order for the user to add an employee, they must create the employee's respective role 
first. To create a role, the user must first create the department that he/she/they/it belongs 
to. If the user decides to view either the department, role or employees tables and they have not 
been created yet they will be notified that the tables are empty.
